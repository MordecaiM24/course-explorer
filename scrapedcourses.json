This course aims to build the intuition that engineers use to understand optical systems and will cover the basic principles of light, such as reflection and refraction, light-wave characteristics, polarization, interference, coherence and more, with an emphasis on optical components that utilize these concepts. A particular focus will be on microscopy and geometrical optics and multiple topics in this area such as: the Abbe theory of image formation, darkfield imaging and fluorescence microscopy. Recent literature in the field will be reviewed and complex imaging systems simplified in order to understand their design principles.

Therefore, whilst an accurate diagnosis represents the first step in dealing with a case, the challenge in this field of medicine is to successfully manage cases in the long term.  This requires good and open communication with the client as well as regular patient evaluation.      Most of the diagnostic techniques employed in dermatology are very simple and do not require expensive equipment or excessive amounts of time.  The key to successful dermatological practice is to use these tools appropriately to recognize conditions such as parasitic infestations and bacterial or yeast infections for which there is a specific course of treatment. It specializes in the diagnosis and management of chronic ear disease and immunological dermatoses such as autoimmune skin diseases, food reactions and atopic dermatitis. The good practitioner however, recognizes that cutaneous manifestations may be a reflection of internal disease and a thorough systemic evaluation is also required.

Derivation of the plasma kinetic equation and the Vlasov equation serve as the starting point to introduce the kinetic study of plasma systems.  From this introduction of the governing equations for full kinetic treatment, methods for analyzing plasma response to electromagnetic and electrostatic perturbations using the linearized Vlasov model for uncorrelated plasmas are introduced.  Kinetic stability of Vlasov plasmas is introduced and the Nyquist method is used to determine conditions for kinetic stability.  The concept of correlated plasmas is then introduced through the introduction of reduced distribution functions and the BBGKY heirarchy.  Finally, simple correlated systems and the Liouville model for two-system correlation is covered to look at the impact of particle correlation due to collisions and coulomb interaction.

You will also discover that cryptography has a much broader range of applications. It solves absolutely paradoxical problems such as proving knowledge of a secret without ever revealing the secret (zero-knowledge proof), or computing the output of a function without ever knowing the input of the function (secure computation).  Finally, we will look closely at one of the recent popular application of cryptography: the blockchain technology. Additionally, graduate students will study some of the topics in greater depth.

Beyond sensationalism and outrage, though, modern societies have taken shape in part through complex debates about the role (or lack thereof) of religion in public life. At the core of these considerations are clashing understandings of the relation between religion and freedom, two broad categories with a range of different meanings. This course will explore these differing understandings by considering: legal arguments proposing freedom of religion, and the challenges of religious pluralism; arguments urging freedom from religion, in defense of secular public life; and invocations of freedom through religion, via human creative expression, social activism, ritual, or cosmology. We will examine not just scholarly writings about religion but literature, films, and other media that have shaped the ongoing conversation.

The idea that emotions are primitive, irrational and dangerous and thus to be controlled and constrained by reason has been embraced by eminent thinkers from Plato and the Stoics to Kant. In this course, we will focus on the relationship between reason and emotion in moral cognition and cognition more generally, and we will investigate how/to what extent reason can be said to be distinct from and superior to emotion.

    "description": "New techniques in genomics have revolutionized biology, but generate large quantities of data that present challenges in extracting signal from noise. This course will provide students the basic skills to manipulate and integrate different types of biological datasets and to learn how to mine them using data analysis tools ranging from basic to state of the art. Machine learning methods provide a framework to analyze vast amounts of biological information and extract meaningful signals. By the end of the semester, students will have had exposure to a variety of modern machine learning tools for classification and prediction. We will focus on exploration of DNA data (with millions of variants), expression data (> 20,000 genes), and microbiome data (thousands of features), combined with various disease/experimental measurements. The course will cover the basics of loading and exploring datasets using visualization, followed by basic machine learning basic methods including classification and regression algorithms.

Methods are given to obtain a non-dynamic system's extremum (minimum or maximum) and use these methods in various engineering applications. This course aims to prepare graduate students with a solid theoretical and mathematical foundation and applied techniques at the intersection of optimization, algorithms, and machine learning to conduct advanced research in related fields. Students will gain expertise in designing algorithms based on common techniques, dealing with intractable problems, and implementing algorithms given the description. Students must undertake a semester-long project (at Google Colab) that practices the optimization theory and algorithms in their areas of interest. These projects can replicate or improve a known solving strategy for a given optimization problem to assess and compare the performance.
